	<h1>Pattern frequency statistics</h1>
	<hr>
	
	Indicators in this group determine the most and less frequent patterns.
	<p>
	
	<ul>
    	<li>Pattern frequency table: computes the number of most frequent records for each distinct pattern.</li>
		<p>
    	<li>Pattern low frequency table: computes the number of less frequent records for each distinct pattern.</li>
		<p>
    	<li>Date pattern frequency table: retrieves the date patterns from date or text columns. It works only with the Java engine.</li>
    	<p>
    	<li>CS Word Pattern Frequency: evaluates the most frequent word patterns. counts the number of record for each distinct pattern. Patterns focus on words and are case sensitive. [Word] represents a word starting with an uppercase character and composed of lowercase characters. [WORD] : represents a word with uppercase characters. [word] represents a word with lowercase characters. [Char] represents a single uppercase character. [char] represents a single lowercase character. </li>
    	<p>
    	<li>CS Word Pattern Low Frequency: evaluates the least frequent word patterns. counts the number of record for each distinct pattern. Patterns focus on words and are case sensitive. [Word] represents a word starting with an uppercase character and composed of lowercase characters. [WORD] : represents a word with uppercase characters. [word] represents a word with lowercase characters. [Char] represents a single uppercase character. [char] represents a single lowercase character. </li>
    	<p>
    	<li>CI Word Pattern Frequency: evaluates the most frequent word patterns. counts the number of record for each distinct pattern. Patterns focus on words and are case insensitive. [word] represents a word, [char] represents a single lowercase character, [alnum] represents an alphanumeric word, [digit] represents a single digit, [number] represents a sequence of digits </li>
