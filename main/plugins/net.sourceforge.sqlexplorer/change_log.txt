+. Fixed problem with detecting query types with GRANT statement (Oracle only)
+. ConnectionsView is now sorted alphabetically, both for aliases and users within aliases
+. Fixed bug where DSView could crash after connection was closed
+. Meta data now is now loaded only once per alias/user, shares connection with DSView
+. Fixed bug where font preference was ignored 
+. Fixed bug where JDBC drivers which do not require a username/password could not be

+. Worked around problem with recycle bin tables in Oracle causing cursor leaks


3.5.0.RC3 - John Spackman, Zenesis Ltd
======================================
+. Getting the extra, RDBMS-specific description info for connections could cause
	a permissions exception; exceptions are handled and quietly suppressed.
+. Fixed issue where CallableStatement can only be used for stored code in some
	JDBC drivers (eg MySQL).  This caused error messages regarding "cannot get
	code for FUNCTION *".  Also fixed problem where calls to commit or rollback
	are not allowed when in auto-commit mode.

+. Fixed bug where connections were not closed even when removed from the connections view
+. Upgraded to current SquirrelSQL library to fix cursor leaks; this affected
	ColumnInfoTab, CreateTableScriptAction, TableNode
+. Fixed bug where creating a new alias would cause an exception if starting for the
	first time
+. Fixed bug where you couldn't add a new JDBC driver
+. Fixed bug where a) max-rows was ignored, and b) changed it to handle the count manually
	instead of via Statement.setMaxRows() because of problems with some RDBMSs (eg MSSQL
	when creating triggers)
+. Fixed bug where editor toolbar save button always did a save-as outside the project, even
	if it had already been saved and given a name
+. Always add an overall update count/rows returned status message after all queries are 
	complete (to make it more obvious that the query has done its work)
+. All connections processes take place in the background
+. Fixed bug where cannot create Oracle triggers because ":old" and ":new" are seen as named 
	parameters
+. Fixed bug where if connection cannot be established while switching sessions, the session 
	drop down shows the not-connected session but stills sits on the old
+. Added RDBMS-specific connection descriptions to ConnectionsView, and whether a it is a 
	pooled connection or not
+. Fixed bug where changing the selected alias/session should not scroll the editor to top of 
	the file
+. Whenever a new editor opens from a project its connection now defaults the most recently 
	selected alias/user from an editor toolbar.
+. Double-click on a user in the connections view opens a new editor

	exception
+. When opening from a project and there are no connections defined, show the connections view 
	and prompt the user to add some.
+. Added various buttons to ConnectionsView toolbar
+. Added "Open Database Structure View" right click option to connections view & toolbar and 
	changed the tabs to be able to individually closed.
+. Fixed bug where filtering did not work in the database structure view


3.5.0.RC1 - John Spackman, Zenesis Ltd
======================================
+. Fixed StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when processing some named parameters
+. Fixed bugs with named parameters where a) support of JDBCv3 was accidentally excluded, b) multiple cursors in a single query were not supported, c) if parameters were used more than once in a single query they were reported back more than once
+. Changed result tab titles for output parameters
+. Fixed bug in Oracle where compound error messages have the first details excluded from the Messages tab
+. Fixed bug in Oracle where line numbers in anonymous pl/sql blocks are not processed properly
+. Fixed bug where named parameters might not show the output value if referenced more than once; also supported the case where output parameters are referenced more than once and therefore have multiple output values.
+. Drivers:
	+. Fixed bug where "Extra Class Path" jars were doubled up each time the preferences was saved.
	+. Validate the ok button after list drivers
	+. If there is an error while connecting, the message is now [more] descriptive
	+. Sort the drivers drop down in connections editor
	+. Create connection only shows valid drivers
	+. Can add/edit drivers from "Edit Connection Profile" page
+. Connections which are closed by the server are detected and re-established next time the connection is used (you should receive one error message about closed connection etc, but the next time you execute all is well)
+. Added auto-commit and commit-on-close to SQL Editor toolbar
+. Fixed caching bug in ImageUtil (se bug report 1627113)


3.5.0.beta2 - John Spackman, Zenesis Ltd
========================================
* Fixed StringIndexOutOfBounds bug in parser
* Fixed Oracle query parser bug where "declare" was not handled properly, plus a few other 
	associated bugs, eg NullPointerException in comments, etc etc
* Fixed bug where DDL commands which caused a SQLException did not record line number info
* Added preference to not log "Success" messages in Messages Tab
* Fixed cannot close result tab by clicking "x"
* Use ResultSetMetaData to get precision & scale for numerical values, and made them right 
	justified.  Note changes to DataSet.
+. Fixed bad title in Export to Excel
+. Fixed bug where compile errors in Oracle could be duplicated
+. Added PostgreSQL plugin back in
+. Connections view now breaks down into alias -> user -> sessions & connections; connections 
	view API; drivers & aliases saved using custom code rather than the JavaBeans style given by
	SquirrelSQL; 
+. History stored as XML rather than custom text format (changes reqd for multiple users)
+. Editors will refuse to run more than one query at a time, and toolbar is disabled during query
	execution
+. Fixed bug where numbers with a high precision (17 or more) were truncated
+. Added support for multiple result sets returned from a single query
+. Added support for named input & output parameters, including Oracle cursors
+. SQL History now records all queries, including those that failed - this allows the user to see 
	which query caused an error
+. When saving untitled (i.e. scratch) files, SE now prompts the user to ask whether these should
	be saved within a project or in the filing system; Eclipse pretty much requires a project in 
	order to work properly so this is a good workaround.  The user can choose to set a default and
	not be asked again.
+. Document JSE versions, making Eclipse use JSE5 even if you're developing for 1.4, etc
+. Adjusted the perspective so that it includes the project explorer, and has a little rearranging
+. Fixed OracleXE login problem
+. NanoXml was not being used, so I removed it in favour of DOM4J
+. AbstractSQLExecution now inherits from Job, for better progress feedback and integration 
	with Eclipse thread management


3.5.0.beta1 - John Spackman, Zenesis Ltd
========================================
SQL Editor
* The separate SqlResultsView has been removed and the query results are now part of 
	the editor that executed them (they appear as tabs in the bottom part of the editor 
	view
* Messages from the database server are now checked for and retrieved after each query,
	and then added to a Messages tab (attached to the editor next to the result tabs).
	The line/column that caused the error is recorded and clicking on a row in the
	Messages tab takes you to the line/character that caused the error
* You no longer need to use special separator characters to break up your SQL code
	(currently this is only supported on Oracle but other databases can be relatively 
	easily added).
* Structured Comments are a new feature which allow you embed instructions to SQLExplorer
	in your SQL scripts.  This can be used for conditional compilation and for macro
	expansion (you'll recognise this straight away if you've previously used C/C++),
	but future versions will support asking the user questions, data type overriding,
	importing, exporting, and client-side scripting with JavaScript.  Because the commands
	are disguised in comments this facility will NOT make your script incompatable with 
	other tools.
* New preferences for:
	a) Clear result tabs on execute
	b) Use long captions on result tabs
	c) Stop processing queries when an error is found
	d) prompt to save modified editors when closing
* Prompt to save files before closing (optional - see preferences)
* Added support for opening files from Eclipse, I.E. via a Project
* Basic online help - this is based on the website plus documentation of new features
* There is a new DatabaseProduct class which can optionally be implemented by a database
	fragment to extend the data types supported and the query parser cabailities (see online 
	help)
* There are new general-purpose QueryParser and Tokenizer classes for reading SQL and Structured 
	Comments.
* Database-specific extensions are required to abstract database specific components which
	do not easily fit into the Eclipse plugin architecture (see DatabaseProduct).
* Added Structured Comments for macros, conditional compilation, and other scriptable 
	functionality without compromising compatability with other, standard SQL tools (this
	can be disabled in preferences).
* Refactored the Preference pages, simplifying the code and extracting commonality
* DataSet now uses reflection to determine data types; there is partial implementation of
	additional datatypes at the moment - work here was stalled and will be completed soon.
* Drivers are loaded by the ClassLoader of the database extension
